# hello-world
my first repo

Hello, my name is Jon.  I like to code in Python, C#, C++, and good ol' fashioned C.
I like messing around with microcontrollers and I'm interested in digital music.
In my free time I like to run, drink coffee, and absorb fantasy novels.  I am anxiously
awaiting the publication of the Winds of Winter, which should come out any day now (probably).
